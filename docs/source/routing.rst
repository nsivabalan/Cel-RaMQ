Routing
=======

Celery supports all of the routing facilities provided by AMQP, but it also supports simple routing where messages are sent to named queues.

The CELERY_ROUTES setting enables you to route tasks by name and keep everything centralized in one location:

celery.conf.update(
    CELERY_ROUTES = {
        'proj.tasks.add': {'queue': 'hipri'},
    },
)

You can also specify the queue at runtime with the queue argument to apply_async:

>>> from proj.tasks import add
>>> add.apply_async((2, 2), queue='hipri')

You can then make a worker consume from this queue by specifying the -Q option:

$ celery -A proj worker -Q hipri

You may specify multiple queues by using a comma separated list, for example you can make the worker consume from both the default queue, and the hipri queue, where the default queue is named celery for historical reasons:

$ celery -A proj worker -Q hipri,celery

The order of the queues doesnâ€™t matter as the worker will give equal weight to the queues.

To learn more about routing, including taking use of the full power of AMQP routing, see the `Routing Guide <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/routing.html#guide-routing>`_.
