===================

Celery requires a solution to send and receive messages, usually this comes in the form of a separate service called a message broker.

There are several choices available, including:

RabbitMQ
-------- 

RabbitMQ is feature-complete, stable, durable and easy to install. It’s an excellent choice for a production environment. Detailed information about using RabbitMQ with Celery:

    Using RabbitMQ

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian install RabbitMQ by executing this command:

$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
