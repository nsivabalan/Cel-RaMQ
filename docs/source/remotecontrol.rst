Remote Control 
===================

If you’re using RabbitMQ (AMQP), Redis or MongoDB as the broker then you can control and inspect the worker at runtime.

For example you can see what tasks the worker is currently working on:

$ celery -A proj inspect active

This is implemented by using broadcast messaging, so all remote control commands are received by every worker in the cluster.

You can also specify one or more workers to act on the request using the --destination option, which is a comma separated list of worker host names:

$ celery -A proj inspect active --destination=worker1.example.com

If a destination is not provided then every worker will act and reply to the request.

The celery inspect command contains commands that does not change anything in the worker, it only replies information and statistics about what is going on inside the worker. For a list of inspect commands you can execute:

$ celery -A proj inspect --help

Then there is the celery control command, which contains commands that actually changes things in the worker at runtime:

$ celery -A proj control --help

For example you can force workers to enable event messages (used for monitoring tasks and workers):

$ celery -A proj control enable_events

When events are enabled you can then start the event dumper to see what the workers are doing:

$ celery -A proj events --dump

or you can start the curses interface:

$ celery -A proj events

when you’re finished monitoring you can disable events again:

$ celery -A proj control disable_events

The celery status command also uses remote control commands and shows a list of online workers in the cluster:

$ celery -A proj status

You can read more about the celery command and monitoring in the `Monitoring Guide <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#guide-monitoring>`_.
